# NodeSchool Kansas City üéìüè´üéí

Welcome to the NodeSchool Kansas City chapter's repository. We use this
repository for our website and much of our communication.

You can see the website here: http://nodeschool.io/kansas-city/


## Talk to us
We are **NEW** chapter and thus we need more mentors and organizers. Please reach out if interested. 

You can join us on our [SLACK CHANNEL](https://nodeschool-kc.herokuapp.com/):

note: this heroku invite app may take a minute to load if it is sleeping...



We also utilize [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nodeschool/kansas-city/issues)
like a message board and try to keep almost all of our communication in the open. If
for any reason you need to contact an organizer privately you may contact us
directly.

## Special thanks

We shamelessly stole much of the content for this repo, our website and event
page from other nodeschools. Thank you!
